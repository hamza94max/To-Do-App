# ToDo App
is a kind of app that generally used to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list everything that we have to do,
with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom.
It is helpful in planning our daily schedules.

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
- __A single-activity architecture__, using the Navigation Components to manage fragment operations.
- __Pattern Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)__ which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
- __Android architecture components__ which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.
